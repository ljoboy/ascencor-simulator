# Simulation of a lift
The program we have made simulates part of the operation of a
lift. The building in which the lift is located has twelve floors and four basements. The lift serves these floors and recognizes the basement floors because they correspond to negative numbers.
Initially, the lift is located on floor 0. There are three basic steps in the operation of the lift
the operation of the lift:
- Calling the lift to a floor;
- Entering the lift followed by the selection of the desired floor;
- The movement of the lift, which can take place between the call and the entry or
  between selection and descent (or ascent).
## Work to be done
The lift walk we have made consists of:
1. Ask for the number of the floor where the lift is called and read it;
2. Display the movement of the lift floor by floor with a delay of 5 seconds between each floor.
   of 2 seconds between each floor.
3. Signal the arrival at the floor of the call;
4. Ask for the desired floor and read it;
5. Move to the selected floor.
<p>To exit the loop, enter a particular floor number (not among our selected digits for example).</p>
